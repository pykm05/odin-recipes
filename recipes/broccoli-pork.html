    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this dish, we'll be using pork marinated(optional) in soy sauce and sugar to make a simple and easy
        meal. We'll begin by putting a light layer of cooking oil in a wok before putting in cut pieces of pork
        slices. Once they're half way cooked, we'll add broccoli, some water, and a little corn starch mixed with
        water at the end.
